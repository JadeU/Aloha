# Aloha

The goal for this project was to translate designer mock ups and project vision into a single page, interactive site for Aloha Apparel Co. HTML and CSS were utilized for bulding and styling, and JavaScript was used to execute the interactivity features. This project was coded for mobile first, with Flexbox being used to create the responsive desing, viewable across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.  A plug in called "Flickity" was also used to animate the carousel of clothing items.

### Personal Learnings 

With this being my first developer project, the learning curve was steep. I now understand the importance of mobile first design, as it made for so much work having to refractor my origninal desktop first designs. I can see the value of starting small and working your way up in screen sizes. There are still many aspects of the project that I want to go back and hone, and definetly practice my Flexbox more. Aside from working on my technical skill in the future months, I want to improve on my soft skills, like aksing for help more readily- instead of getting hung up spending hours trying to figure out tiny code issues on my own.
